**Instalation**

In order to run the chatbot, you first need to generate an api token in gemini, then create an ```.env``` containing ```GEMINI_API_KEY=your api key```.

once this is ready, we need to run both the backend(bot) and the frotend, for this we need node and npm for the frontend, and python in backend.

**Frontend**:
move to the frontend directory, once inside run ```npm install``` and ```npm run dev```.
_Note: bakend needs to be running for the chatbot to work._

**Backend**:
move to the backend directory, inside the directory run ```pip install -r requeriments.txt```, then run ```python3 app.py```
